# Cricket Player Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive analysis of cricket player data. The analysis includes data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of a Ridge regression model. The project aims to gain insights into the performance of cricket players based on various features.

## Data
- **Original Dataset:** The original dataset is available on Kaggle at [ESPN Cricket Players Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/espn-cricket-players).
- **Cleaned Dataset:** The cleaned dataset used in this analysis is provided in the file [Cleaned-Cricket-Dataset.csv](./Cleaned-Cricket-Dataset.csv).

## [NoteBook](./Cricket_Analysis.ipynb)
1. **Data Wrangling:**
    - This notebook contains the code for cleaning and preprocessing the raw cricket player dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Explore and visualize key features of the cricket player dataset to gain insights.

3. **Regression Model:**
    - Implement a regression model to predict cricket player runs scored based on selected features.

## Deliverables
- The project includes PDF files containing the deliverables submitted for analysis.

    - [Deliverable-1.pdf](./Deliverable-1.pdf): Detailed Deliverable on the problem statement, source of dataset and description of dataset
    
    - [Deliverable-2.pdf](./Deliverable-2.pdf): Deliverable regarding Data Summary, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, analysis and the key findings.
